                - Wake-up Time: ${wakeuptime}

                As a sleep specialist:

                - Account for their profession and optimize sleep quality without disrupting productivity
                - Include blocks like "Wind Down", "Phone Off", "In Bed", "Wake Up", "Light Exposure", "Focus Block", etc.
                - Dont repeat the schedule for all days, make schedule of each day unique and natural.
                - Give schedule for whole day i.e 24hrs and make study hours/work hours fit into properly with sleep as required.
                - Make the plans realistic and human like dont just change the wake up and sleep times on all days just to be unique, make the whol daily routines natural and full personalised for the profession and workhours/studyhours.
